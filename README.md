# Dynamic Voting Protocol

The Dynamic Voting Protocol is a decentralized system designed to enhance collective decision-making by rewarding informed participation and penalizing manipulation. Built on three core pillars—dynamic voting weight based on thematic reputation, weighted vote delegation, and consensus-driven bridging strategies—

This protocol leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, auditability, and resistance to abuse. It aims to create a fairer, more representative voting system where expertise and diverse consensus shape outcomes, ultimately fostering trust and empowerment in decision-making processes.
