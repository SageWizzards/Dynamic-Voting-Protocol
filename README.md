## Abstract

The Dynamic Voting Protocol is a decentralized system designed to enhance collective decision-making by rewarding informed participation and penalizing manipulation. Built on three core pillars—dynamic voting weight based on thematic reputation, weighted vote delegation, and consensus-driven bridging strategies—this protocol leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, auditability, and resistance to abuse. It aims to create a fairer, more representative voting system where expertise and diverse consensus shape outcomes, ultimately fostering trust and empowerment in decision-making processes.

## 1. Background

Collective decision-making has long faced challenges such as manipulation by uninformed or coordinated groups, lack of transparency, and difficulty ensuring diverse representation. Traditional voting systems often rely on simple majority rule, which can overlook expertise and marginalize minority perspectives. Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing an immutable, transparent ledger, but it alone does not address the need for informed participation or consensus across diverse groups. The Dynamic Voting Protocol builds on these foundations, introducing a system where voting power reflects thematic expertise, delegation enhances flexibility, and bridging strategies ensure broad consensus, aiming to create a more equitable and effective decision-making framework.

---

## 2. Protocol Overview

The Dynamic Voting Protocol is a decentralized decision-making system that empowers voters to participate in collective choices with weights dynamically adjusted based on their thematic reputation, allows vote delegation to trusted experts, and employs bridging strategies to foster consensus among diverse groups. Leveraging blockchain, it ensures transparency and integrity while enabling applications like DAO governance, public consultations, and community debates.

---

## 3. Main Components

### 3.1. Voter Profiles

Voter profiles are structured records containing thematic reputation scores, voting history, and connections, serving as the foundation for weighted participation.

### 3.2. Reputation Assessments

Reputation is assessed through peer evaluations, verified contributions, and past voting accuracy, ensuring that expertise influences voting weight.

### 3.3. Vote Delegation

Users can delegate their votes to others with higher thematic reputation, with weights adjusted proportionally to maintain balance.

### 3.4. Bridging Strategies

Bridging algorithms identify diverse voter groups and enhance vote weights for decisions supported across these groups, promoting inclusivity.

### 3.5. Verifications

Crowdsourced, public verifications prevent fake accounts and ensure participant authenticity.

### 3.6. Connections

Voters can form reciprocal connections, creating a network that informs reputation and delegation dynamics.

### 3.7. Decentralized Network

The protocol operates on a blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency while enabling permissionless innovation.

### 3.8. Participants

#### 3.8.1. Voters (End-Users)

Voters create profiles, cast votes, delegate voting power, and authorize data access.

#### 3.8.2. Storers

Storers interface between voters and the blockchain, adding and updating data.

#### 3.8.3. Nodes (Miners)

Nodes maintain the ledger, calculate vote weights, and process transactions, earning rewards.

#### 3.8.4. Retrievers

Retrievers access and publish voter data, enabling applications to utilize the protocol.

### 3.9. Incentives

#### 3.9.1. Overview

Incentives encourage honest participation and network maintenance through tokens and reputation gains.

#### 3.9.2. Motivators

Voters are motivated by control over their influence, while nodes earn tokens for computational efforts.

### 3.10. Governance

Governance is split between token holders and active voters, with decisions made via weighted voting.

---

## 4. Vote Weight Calculation

### 4.1. Formula

The weight of a vote (\( W_v \)) is calculated as:

\[ W_v = R_t \times D \times B \times Q \]

- \( R_t \): Thematic reputation (0 to 1), capped to prevent dominance.
- \( D \): Delegation factor (0 to 1), reflecting delegated vote weight.
- \( B \): Bridging factor (0 to 1), enhancing consensus across groups.
- \( Q \): Quality score (0 to 1), based on justification rigor.

### 4.2. Reputation Dynamics

Reputation decays over time unless validated by new contributions, ensuring ongoing engagement.

---

## 5. Privacy, Authentication, and Encryption

### 5.1. Privacy

Public data enhances transparency, while sensitive information is encrypted.

### 5.2. Encryption and Authentication

Users manage public-private key pairs for authentication and data protection, supported by protocol-specific wallets.

---

## 6. Data Structures

### 6.1. Account

- **Plain Text**: ID, Name, Verified Status
- **Encrypted**: Key History

### 6.2. Profile

- **Plain Text**: Account ID, Thematic Reputation
- **Encrypted**: Contact Details

### 6.3. Reputation Record

- **Plain Text**: Evaluator ID, Evaluated ID, Theme, Score

### 6.4. Delegation

- **Plain Text**: Delegator ID, Delegate ID, Theme, Weight

### 6.5. Vote

- **Plain Text**: Vote ID, Voter ID, Decision, Weight

---

## 7. Protocol Sketch

### 7.1. Storer Cycle

Storers create accounts, update profiles, and submit votes or delegations.

### 7.2. Node Cycle

Nodes validate transactions, calculate weights, and update the ledger.

### 7.3. Retriever Cycle

Retrievers monitor the ledger and publish data for applications.

---

## 8. Rewards for Nodes (Miners)

Nodes earn tokens based on transaction complexity and storer quality, ensuring a free service for users.

---

## 9. Blockchain Technology

A dual-blockchain approach separates data storage and token management, optimizing scalability and liquidity.

---

## 10. Protection Against Abuse and Manipulation

### 10.1. Reputation

Reputation is seeded through verified users and capped to prevent monopolies.

### 10.2. Verifications

Public verifications ensure authenticity, with retractable but indelible records.

### 10.3. Incentives

Intrinsic motivators dominate, with tokens reserved for nodes.

### 10.4. Quality Scores

Storers with poor scores face request limits, deterring spam.

---

## 11. Applications

### 11.1. Improvements for Existing Use Cases

- **DAO Governance**: Fairer voting with expert influence.
- **Public Consultations**: Transparent, representative outcomes.

### 11.2. Potential New Use Cases

- **Community Debates**: Highlighting informed consensus.
- **Policy Development**: Bridging diverse stakeholder input.

---

## 12. Open Questions and Ongoing Work

- How to optimize bridging for large-scale consensus?
- What safeguards prevent coercion in vote delegation?
- Can the protocol scale to millions of voters efficiently?
